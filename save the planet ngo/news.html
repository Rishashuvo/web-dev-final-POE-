            <h2>Deforestation Rates Skyrocket</h2>
            <p>In the last 10 years, deforestation has increased by 20%. This rampant destruction of forests not only destroys ecosystems but also contributes to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide stored in trees. The Amazon, known as the "lungs of the Earth," is particularly at risk.</p>
